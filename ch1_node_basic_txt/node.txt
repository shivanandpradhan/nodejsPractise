nodejs --popular 

It is popular due to its asynchronous behaviour....

a common task of the web server to open a file and then return the content to the client.

Php handles the file request :- 
    - sends the task to the computer file system
    - waits while the file system opens and reads the file.
    - returns the content to the client.
    - ready to handle the next request.

Node Js handles the file request :-
    - send the task to the computer file system.
    - ready to handle the next request.
    - when the file system has opened and read the file, the server return the content ot the client.
    
- Node Js eliminate the waiting and simply continues with the next request. 
- It runs single-threaded, non - blocking,asynchronous programming, which is memory efficient.
